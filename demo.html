<div class = "Mark">Experience and Interaction</div>To provide more realistic experience, we detect the running action and connect it with the player’s movement in VR.


<div class = "Mark">Inspiration</div>In the 21st century, with an explosion of diverse values readily available to follow and numerous life paths worth dedicating ourselves to, we often find ourselves indecisive. This confusion and uncertainty frequently lead us to blindly follow safe and popular trends, leaving our inner selves empty.

This profound emptiness drives us to continuously explore. Even though we remain uncertain about the direction and goals of life, our footsteps hesitate to pause, fearing falling behind an imaginary opponent. Unsure of what lies ahead, we engage in a series of frenzied sprints...

This extreme uneasiness about the future reminds us of the imagery portrayed in Charles Baudelaire's poem "Everyone has their own dream (Chacun sa chimère)": groups of travelers carry their dreams or illusions, running filled with hope. These individuals fearlessly endure harsh reality, with the weight of their dreams akin to a Chimera crawling on their backs, its enormous claws tearing at their chests. When the author curiously asks about their destination, the response is, "I don't know anything."


<div class = "Mark">VR Content Description</div>Through complete immersion generated by a first-person perspective in virtual reality, we create a unique space for you to experience the pressure and circumstances influenced by the crowd.

In the fantastical world we have created, by swinging your arms in the real world, you will find yourself running aimlessly through infinite terrain generated by an Endless Procedural Random Map. Regardless of the direction you run or whether you simply prefer to stay in one place, dynamically generated crowds will surprise you. Among seemingly identical individuals, we use Procedural Animation to create individual differences. Through exaggerated body language and other approaches, we generate different visual patterns to depict our relationship with society; these could be crowds dispersing in the wind, following you all the way, or intimidating you with gigantic mythical beasts.

Throughout the entire experience, you will encounter impactful and immense spectacles along with heart-stirring sound design. While you may not find a sense of belonging in reality, one thing is certain – you won't stop running! You will navigate through one group after another until…



Additional diverse styles of scenes and characters are currently in the development phase and will be unveiled in the final showcase.</pre>
